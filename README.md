# Deep Learning Projects
This repository contains various deep learning projects and experiments, and will continue to be updated with new projects and improvements as I progress in deep learning. The projects explore different deep learning architectures and techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and more. The goal is to apply machine learning to real-world problems, with each project focusing on a specific application or challenge.

Projects Included:

Garbage Classification: A deep learning model for classifying different types of waste to support waste management and recycling.

Technologies Used:

TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
Python
OpenCV, scikit-learn

Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute!
